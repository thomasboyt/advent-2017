Here's my [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) answers for 2017.

For the most part, I've tried to solve these as if they were interview questions asked, rather than code golfing or going for particularly elegant solutions. It's more of a `while (true) {...}` kinda thing than a bunch of beautiful functional code.

Since I'm lazy and don't like manually checking things, I wrote up the various examples that the problems have as test cases in Jest, which can be run individually like:

```
npm test -- 05/05-p2.test.js
```

`--watch` can be passed to automatically rerun them.
